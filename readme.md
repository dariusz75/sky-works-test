#Creative brief

##The design file contains three frames which you must animate in the web banner.


###Frame 1
The background image should appear immediately on the first frame.
The two products () should appear immediately on the first frame.
The Sky logo should appear immediately on the first frame.
Fade in the text with the gradient.
Then fade in the blue copy.
The banner should wait for two seconds with all frame 1 content on the screen.
Fade out all content on frame one except the background image and Sky logo.

###Frame 2
Fade in the text with the gradient.
Then fade in the grey copy.
At the same time as the grey copy animate the gradient stamp (12 Months FREE SKY BROADBAND UNLIMITED) should animate from the top (off screen) to its final position, and bounce when it lands. You need to create an effect that makes it appear to fall from the sky and bounce a bit on the ground when it lands.
Fade out all content on frame 2 except the background image and the Sky logo.

###Frame 3
The call to action ("Find out more") button image should appear immediately on the third frame.
Fade in the text with the gradient.
Then fade in the blue copy.
Then fade in the "Limited time offer" gradient copy.
Then fade in the grey copy.
Then animate a white blurred sheen (reference) across the call to action ("Find out more") button.

_Please note that the banner should stop animating after a duration of fifthteen seconds._
